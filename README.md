### What is Sevens?
Sevens is a card game. You can find the rules here:
[Sevens Rules](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Sevens-(Card-Game))

### Usage
If you wish to run sevens, you can clone this repository to your machine. 
From there you are able to load it in an IDE and launch it there. 
While maven has been set up for the project, running it in the command line will not show the text colouring correctly - TODO.

### Purpose
This project has been created as a task in FPSE, to start learning about Test Driven Development and writing Unit Tests.
